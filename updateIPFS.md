3. ```gx publish``` and get the has for the base IPFS repo.
4. Copy all the files from: ```$GOPATH/src/gx``` into this projects vendor/gx directory.
5. Update all the import paths.
6. Run:
```
    	find vendor/gx/ -name 'trace.go' -exec sed -i '.bak' -e 's/requests"/requestss"/g' {} \;
    	find vendor/gx/ -name 'trace.go' -exec sed -i '.bak' -e 's/events"/eventss"/g' {} \;
    	find vendor/gx/ -name '*.bak' -type f -exec rm -f {} +
